The universe (which others call the Library) consists of an indefinite number, and

appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if
it really was, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that the surfaces

They are named after lamps. There are two in each hexagon: transverse. the light that
they emit is insufficient, incessant.
